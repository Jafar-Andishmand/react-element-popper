  "important_notes": [
    "The most important thing is that this library only tries to be in the position you specified! This is because the arrangement of the elements containing the refrence element may be such that the popper does not fit in that position, or the user may start scrolling or resizing the page, in which case the popper position will change. Of course, you can force the element popper to show the popper position exactly where you want it, in which case you should use the fixMainPosition and fixRelativePosition properties.",
    "Do not use margins and padding to create a space between the popper and the refrence element, and instead use the offsetY and offsetX properties.",
    "Do not try to change the element popper container position to relative with CSS or Style, because it will disrupt the calculations.",
